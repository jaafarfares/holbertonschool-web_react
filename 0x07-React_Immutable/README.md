# 0x07. React Immutable



##### React Immutable is a library that brings immutable data structures and utilities to React applications. It ensures data integrity by preventing mutations and encourages predictable state management. With React Immutable, you can efficiently update and compare immutable data, reducing unnecessary re-renders and optimizing performance. It simplifies debugging and promotes functional programming principles, making it easier to reason about state changes. By embracing immutability, React Immutable enhances the efficiency, reliability, and maintainability of React applications.
