# 0x04. React component


#### In React, a component is a reusable building block that encapsulates a specific functionality and user interface. Components are the fundamental building blocks of a React application and can be considered as self-contained units of code that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces.

#### React components can be classified into two types: functional components and class components.
